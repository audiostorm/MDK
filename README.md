Universal Guitar Pedal Effects Daughterboard System (AKA the Mandrake System!)

This project is an open-source connection system that allows creators to build effects pedals and daughterboards that add secondary effects to those pedals, to a standard that allows interoperability with any other brand or manufacturer that adheres to the standard. Being open source there are no fees, or royalties due, no limits to usage, and I take no responsibility for damages caused by your designs or use of this format.
